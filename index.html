    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

    This Privacy Policy outlines how Dog Training ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users ("you" or "your") of the Dog Training mobile application.
    <h4>Information Collection</h4>
    
    Our app uses the camera and microphone functionalities solely for specific features that enhance the user experience. However, please note that we do not collect data from these sources.
    Additionally, we store user game records locally on the device on which the app is downloaded, in a JSON file, for dog training purposes. This stored data does not contain any sensitive information and is solely used to enhance the training experience within the app. We do not utilise cloud storage for this purpose.
    The speech-to-text services integrated into our app, provided by Google and Starseed, facilitate voice data conversion into text for API calls. We do not retain, store, or access voice data processed through these services. The information is solely used for the intended purpose of the API calls and is not stored on our servers or databases.
    <h4>How We Use Collected Information</h4>    
    Any data processed through the speech-to-text services is strictly utilised for immediate API calls to provide relevant features within the app. The user's game records stored locally are used solely to enhance the app's dog training experience. We do not share or transmit this information outside the user's device.
    <h4>Data Security</h4>    
    We prioritise the security and privacy of your information. Although the app stores user game records locally on the device, we do not transmit this data over the internet or share it with external sources. It remains securely stored within the user's device.
    <h4> Third-Party Services</h4> 
    Please note that you may be directed to third-party services or websites not under our control when using our app. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these services as we cannot be held responsible for their practices.
    <h4> Children's Privacy</h4> 
    
    Our app is open to all users, including children and adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately, and we will take the necessary steps to delete it.

    <h4>  Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>    
   
    We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy anytime. Any changes made will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this policy. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes.
